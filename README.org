* What

Wolfram Language (Mathematica) Package for computations involving the
Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM)

Q. Are atoms discernible in molecules? 

A. Yes, an atom can be defined as the union of steepest ascent
gradient paths through the electron density, and its attractor. These
atoms are individually proper quantum systems exhibiting the same
boundary conditions that are applied to the molecule as a
whole. (i.e. the zero-flux condition that applies to isolated
molecules and crystals)

All examples here are for water molecule (H2O).

* Why

I have always wanted a high-level Mathematica interface to
commonly-performed QTAIM tasks. This is for both research and teaching
purposes, especially creating highly customized graphics.

Two anticipated use cases are: 1) Teaching QTAIM background and methods
 and 2) generating annotated graphics. QTAIM.wl is the bridge 
between QTAIM-computed quantities and the Mathematica ecosystem.

A key characteristic of Mathematica is that can create very high
quality graphics and in such a way that they are adaptively sampled,
in the space of a graphics routine, i.e. Cartesian, rather than
e.g. spherical polar grids. This reduces a certain kind of artifact
that I often see. (Though this can be done when appropriate.)

Also, Wolfram Language/Mathematica has a nice graphics grammar, that
make composing tailored graphics easy and the results are nice.

Wolfram Engine is basically free for certain use, so there's much less
to complain about concerning Wolfram Language as an implementation. A
determined person can figure it out. :-)

* Why not
This is not a project to do "production" QTAIM, but rather to explain
what QTAIM is and make nice graphics, and a way to investigate easily
some of the numerical issues that underpin it.  I always err on the
side of slow and reliable.  If QTAIM.wl is useful for production, that
is a collateral benefit.

An example of something that I am interested in is comparing ODE methods 
for steepest-ascent paths.
Mathematica has a broad suite of ODE algorithms that have the same interface.

* Installation Notes
** MathLink Executable

Note: This step is somewhat optional, but still required for WFN file
import!  TODO: write wfn2wfx.f90.   Also, there are a number of ways around this,
including molden2aim.

An example, using MacPorts gfortran and MathLink's mcc in my PATH
variable (I may have hacked mcc script in a couple places to first
find gcc-mp-12, so it might not need -lgfortran):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  export PATH=/Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/MacOSX-ARM64/CompilerAdditions:${PATH}
  gfortran-mp-12 -O3 -fPIC -c -o qtaim.o qtaim.f90
  mcc -n qtaim.o qtaim.tm main.c -o qtaim -lgfortran
#+END_src

on GNU/Linux, you may have to link gfortran:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # sudo apt install build-essential gcc g++ gfortran
  gfortran -O3 -fPIC -c -o qtaim.o qtaim.f90
  mcc -b64 qtaim.o qtaim.tm main.c -o qtaim -lgfortran
#+END_src

I would appreciate it if someone would provide instructions for
windows, but I suspect they are similar.

All this is because the electron density and gradient evaluations are so
plentiful and expensive, that they must be executed in a compiled
language.

Another reason is that the WFN format is of at least historical interest and it's
Fortran-formatted. So here bite the bullet and have a Fortran/MathLink
dependency.

An advantage is that it is a mechanism for interfacing with other
codes.  One simply needs to add C/Fortran code and write the interface
like the example for *rho1*, /vide infra/.

* Example Uses

** Wavefunctions
   - WFX, WFN import
   - PySCF (examples give full-valence CASSCF of water)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install pyscf
  pip install pyscf[geomopt]
  ...
#+END_src
  
** Electron Density of Water (Center Planes)

   Mathematica 12 has beautiful slice plots:
   
[[https://github.com/ecbrown/QTAIM.wl/blob/master/resource/center-planes-of-water-electron-density.png?raw=true]]


** Locate Nuclear Critical Points (and Plot Them)
   The first task is locate the nuclear critical points:
   
[[https://github.com/ecbrown/QTAIM.wl/blob/master/resource/nuclear-critical-points-of-water.png?raw=true]]

** Locate Bond Critical Points (and Plot Them)
   The second task is locate the bond critical points. This uses a
   graphical technique inside of Mathematica. There are no heuristics.

** Electron Density of Water (Contour Plot)

  Symmetrical molecules contain a lot of information along planes.

** Electron Density of Water (Contour Plot)

  It is easy to compose images with different quantities. The bond
  paths shown in the 3D model above can be projected onto the plane:

** Electron Density Gradient of Water (Stream Plots)

   In the QTAIM, atoms are defined by regions of space that are the
   union of all steepest ascent paths through the electron density and
   the attractor.

** (Negative of) Laplacian of Electron Density

   "Lone Pairs" of electrons can be located by finding maxima in the
   negative of the Laplacian of the electron density.  A feature of
   QTAIM.wl is that is uses the same techniques to find critical
   points in the Laplacian as it does in the electron density.

* Noteworthy Features, Novelties, and other Curiosities (Incomplete Laundry List)
  - [[https://aoterodelaroza.github.io/critic2][Critic2]] / AIMAll / MultiWFN etc. are great and I recommend these
    results be checked against them
  - Infinite-order analytical partial derivatives based on two
    applications of Leibniz Product Rule of Cartesian GTOs. The best
    way to find roots is with Hessian information.  Since the
    Laplacian of the electron density already needs second
    derivatives, its Hessian needs fourth order derivatives! This is
    too high a derivative to hand code, and everything here is very
    stiff for numerical differentiation.  Written in Modern Fortran.
  - Molecular graphs are computed using "J.M."'s StackExchange for 3D
    critical point location. This technique generalizes to fields for
    which there may not be heuristics for searching, e.g. bond paths
    between two nuclear critical points.  This includes the Laplacian
    field, as well all other imaginable, such as Kinetic Energy
    Density topology.
  - Data generated adaptively depending on task.  Eschews precomputed
    grids.
  - Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (ABM) integrator with variable order/step
    due to Shampine and Watts (DEABM).  We already know these are
    going start or are going to get stiff, so even better than
    Doermand-Prince.  Need to verify this since tuning beta spheres.
  - Mathematica's infinite possibilities for styling graphics,
    scripting, orchestrating, extending, and exploring
  - Parallelization opportunities abound because its easy to
    subdivide a number of these methods into subregions and then
    combine. (Split-Apply-Combine over different computer architectures!)
  - Written in a language that is rich with "scientific methods"
    e.g. has e.g. Hermite Polynomials built-in.
  - I can't tell if this package is slow, or just that accurate images
    without jagged edges just take a long time to compute. Note that
    parallelization may be found at the frame/configuration/atom level
    as well, it does not have to be serial.  Again just getting this
    stood up, many order-saving optimizations to come.
  - Other packages for QTAIM exist and they can be interfaced
    e.g. through files and/or linking.  These functions should work
    with interpolated functions as well.  I am currently investigating
    how [[https://aoterodelaroza.github.io/critic2][Critic2]]'s results can be utilized.  Its routines cover
    additional domains such as solid state and this package could be
    "just graphics" in certain cases.
